1.  **Project Initialization and Analysis:**
    *   Create `PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
    *   Analyze `llms.txt` (already done), `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `cleanup.py`, and other key files to understand the current state.
    *   Identify the core purpose of `twat-speech` for its v1.0 MVP. (Self-note: The current code is a template. For now, I will assume the MVP is to have a *working* template that correctly implements the placeholder `process_data` and passes all checks, rather than implementing actual speech processing logic unless specified otherwise by the user).

2.  **Address Immediate Issues & Configuration:**
    *   Fix the failing test `tests/test_twat_speech.py::test_version` (AttributeError for `__version__`). This likely involves ensuring `src/twat_speech/__init__.py` correctly imports and exposes `__version__`.
    *   Fix the mypy error identified in `CLEANUP.txt` (`tests/test_twat_speech.py:4: error: Function is missing a return type annotation`).
    *   Ensure `src/twat_speech/__init__.py` correctly exports `Config` and `process_data`.
    *   Create an empty `TODO.md` file as it's reported missing by `cleanup.py` and is part of the user request.

3.  **Streamline `cleanup.py`:**
    *   **Evaluate `cleanup.py` commands:**
        *   `status`: Determine if `git status`, `hatch run all` (or similar combination of lint/test commands), and manual tree inspection can replace its output. The automatic generation of `filetree.mdc` might be a Cursor-specific utility.
        *   `venv`, `install`: `hatch shell` and `hatch env create` / `hatch dep sync` largely cover this. `uv pip install -e .[test,dev]` is also standard.
        *   `update`: Git commands (`git add .`, `git commit`) are standard. The auto-commit message "Update repository files" is very generic.
        *   `push`: Standard `git push`.
        *   `repomix` call: The user requested `llms.txt` (generated by `npx repomix`). `cleanup.py` generates `REPO_CONTENT.txt`. Clarify if `REPO_CONTENT.txt` is still needed.
    *   **Decision:** Based on evaluation, significantly slim down or remove `cleanup.py`.
        *   If kept, remove redundant environment activation logic.
        *   If kept, ensure its logging to `CLEANUP.txt` is still valuable or can be replaced by git logs/CI.
        *   Remove the `repomix` call that generates `REPO_CONTENT.txt` if `llms.txt` is the preferred artifact.
    *   Update `.cursor/rules/cleanup.mdc` to reflect any changes to `cleanup.py` or its removal.

4.  **Handle Obsolete/Redundant Files:**
    *   **`VERSION.txt`**: Given `hatch-vcs` dynamically manages the version from Git tags into `src/twat_speech/__version__.py`, `VERSION.txt` is likely obsolete. Confirm and remove.
    *   **`package.toml`**: This file's purpose is unclear given `pyproject.toml`. It seems like a config for a project generator. Investigate if it's used; if not, remove it.
    *   **`REPO_CONTENT.txt`**: If `llms.txt` (generated by `npx repomix`) is the primary full-codebase file for AI, and `cleanup.py`'s `repomix` call is removed/changed, then `REPO_CONTENT.txt` might be redundant. Remove if confirmed.
    *   **`CLEANUP.txt`**: Evaluate if this log file is necessary or if its purpose is served by `git log` and CI job logs. Consider removing it if `cleanup.py` is heavily modified or removed.

5.  **Refine Core Code (`src/twat_speech/twat_speech.py`):**
    *   Ensure the placeholder `process_data` function has a clear, albeit simple, behavior for the MVP (e.g., returns a dictionary with input metadata).
    *   Ensure logging within `process_data` is reasonable and the debug flag correctly controls verbosity without errors.
    *   Review the `main()` function. If it's purely for demonstration, ensure it's clear. Consider if a CLI entry point via `pyproject.toml [project.scripts]` would be more appropriate for an MVP, even if it just calls this demo main.

6.  **Review and Update Documentation and Configuration:**
    *   Update `README.md` to reflect any changes from the streamlining process (e.g., usage of `cleanup.py`, project structure).
    *   Ensure `pyproject.toml` is consistent with the streamlined project (e.g., dependencies, scripts).
    *   Review `.gitignore` for any necessary adjustments.
    *   Review `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to ensure it aligns with the quality tools being used. Add mypy to pre-commit if not already effectively covered by hatch environments. (It seems it is already there).

7.  **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
    *   Expand tests in `tests/test_twat_speech.py` to cover the defined MVP behavior of `process_data`.
    *   Ensure all tests pass.
    *   Ensure `hatch run lint:all` (or equivalent ruff, mypy checks) passes.
    *   Run `npx repomix -o ./llms.txt .` again after changes to ensure the AI-consumable file is up-to-date.

8.  **Final Review and Submission:**
    *   Review all changes made.
    *   Update `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` to mark completed tasks.
    *   Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of changes.
    *   Submit the changes with a descriptive commit message.
